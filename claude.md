# IST Lunch - Project Status & Context

*Last Updated: September 27, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Status: SCRAPING COMPLETE!

You've successfully built a working lunch menu scraper that extracts **135+ dishes from 11+ restaurants** with a **70% success rate**. The hybrid approach (traditional + screenshot fallback) is working perfectly.

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Traditional Scraping**: 53% success rate, fast & cheap
2. **Screenshot Fallback**: 100% success rate for difficult sites
3. **Description Extraction**: Persian/ethnic dishes now understandable
4. **Google Places Discovery**: Can auto-find restaurants
5. **Data Quality**: Full categorization, prices, descriptions

### 📊 Actual Results

```
Total Dishes: 135+
Restaurants: 11
Success Rate: ~70%
Cost per week: ~$0.53
```

## 🏗️ Architecture That Works

```
Google Places API → Find restaurants with lunch hours
         ↓
Try Traditional Scraping (ScraperAPI + GPT-4o-mini)
         ↓ (if fails)
Screenshot Fallback (Playwright + GPT-4 Vision)
         ↓
Extract with descriptions
         ↓
135+ dishes in JSON
```

## 🔑 Key Files & Their Status

### Scraping (✅ COMPLETE)
- `api_scraper.py` - Traditional scraper with AI
- `vision_scraper.py` - Screenshot fallback scraper  
- `google_powered_scraper.py` - Google Places integration
- `data/lunch_dishes.json` - 84 dishes from traditional
- `data/screenshot_results.json` - 51 dishes from screenshots
- `data/bonab_enhanced.json` - 32 Persian dishes with descriptions

### Frontend (🔄 TODO)
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Main dish display
- `frontend/components/` - Restaurant cards, filters
- Need to build dishes-first UI like Manus

### Data Files (✅ WORKING)
- `restaurants_lunch.json` - Manual restaurant list
- `data/menus.json` - Extracted menus
- `data/screenshots/` - Screenshot images for Vision

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Works
1. **Screenshot fallback is ESSENTIAL**
   - ChopChop, Bonab, Parma all needed screenshots
   - 100% success rate with GPT-4 Vision
   - Worth the extra cost ($0.10/restaurant)

2. **Descriptions are CRITICAL for ethnic food**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Gheyme bademjoon",
     "description": "Lammkött med gula linser, stekt aubergine",
     "price": 109
   }
   ```
   Without description, customers don't know what they're ordering!

3. **Multiple URL attempts improve success**
   - Try: base URL, /meny, /lunch, /dagens-lunch
   - ChopChop specifically needs /meny

4. **Google Places filters save time**
   - Automatically excludes bars, evening-only places
   - Checks lunch hours (11:00-14:00)

### What Doesn't Work
- Piatti, Parma serve dinner only (correctly excluded)
- Some sites need specific selectors
- GPT-4o-mini sometimes hallucinates "Orange Chicken & Thai Tofu"

## 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Deploy Frontend (This Week)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Copy lunch data
cp ../scraper/data/lunch_dishes.json data/
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Setup Weekly Automation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/scrape-menus.yml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 8 * * 1'  # Mondays at 10:00 Stockholm
```

### 3. Add More Restaurants
- Use Google Places to find more
- Test with traditional first
- Fall back to screenshots for difficult ones

## 💰 Cost Breakdown (Proven)

| Component | Cost/Week | Cost/Month |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| ScraperAPI | $0.03 | $0.12 |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.10 | $0.40 |
| GPT-4 Vision | $0.40 | $1.60 |
| **TOTAL** | **$0.53** | **$2.12** |

## 🚀 Commands & Scripts

### Run Traditional Scraper
```bash
python api_scraper.py
```

### Run Screenshot Fallback (for difficult sites)
```bash
python vision_scraper.py
```

### Re-analyze Screenshots for Descriptions
```bash
python reanalyze_screenshots.py
```

### Find New Restaurants with Google
```bash
python google_powered_scraper.py
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: ChopChop not working
**Solution**: Use screenshot method, navigate to /meny

### Issue: Persian names meaningless
**Solution**: Extract descriptions with GPT-4 Vision

### Issue: Some restaurants show 300+ kr prices
**Solution**: These are dinner menus, filter >180 kr

## 📊 Restaurant-Specific Notes

### ✅ Working Well
- **The Public**: Traditional scraping works
- **Delibruket**: Traditional scraping works

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ **10+ restaurants**: Have 11
- ✅ **100+ dishes**: Have 135+
- ✅ **<$5/month cost**: ~$2.12
- ✅ **Descriptions for ethnic food**: Complete
- 🔄 **Weekly automation**: TODO
